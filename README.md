# Inventory Organization Utility
As a worker in a steel yard, I am having trouble finding material. I would like a tool to help me deliver material to the correct place when ordered, and easily find material for use later.  Any change to inventory should notify someone in the ordering department.

WHEN I select a material  
THEN I will be able to select additional parameters for that material.  
WHEN I have selected the material  
THEN I should be directed to a map with the location of that material.  
WHEN I select an email recipient  
THEN an email should be generated with a list of material, parameters, quantity, and whether it is being picked up or dropped off.  
WHEN I send the email  
THEN I should be notified that the email was sent properly.  


## Functionality

Utilized HTML, Bulma, CSS, and jQuery to create dynamic webpages that are easy to use and read. Used the [Google Maps api](https://developers.google.com/maps) as well as [SMTPjs.com](https://www.smtpjs.com/) to email the inventory department.
